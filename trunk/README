Term::ReadLine::Gnu --- GNU Readline Library Wrapper Module

	Copyright (c) 1996,1997,1998 Hiroo Hayashi.  All rights reserved.

	This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
	modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.

Description:

	This is an implementation of the interface to the GNU Readline
	Library.  This module gives you input line editing facility,
	input history management facility, word completion facility,
	etc.  It uses the real GNU Readline Library.  And this module
	has the interface with the almost all variables and functions
	which are documented in the GNU Readline/History Library.  So
	you can program your custom editing function, your custom
	completion function, and so on with Perl.  This may be useful
	for prototyping before programming with C.

	Ilya Zakharevich distributes his implementation, which bases
	on Jeffrey Friedl's readline.pl.  His module works very well,
	and is easy to install because it is written by only Perl.  I
	am trying to make my module compatible with his.  He gives
	useful advises for me.

	Unfortunately readline.pl simulates old GNU Readline library.
	For example, it is not 8 bit clean and it warns to the
	variables in ~/.inputrc which it does not know yet.  We
	Japanese usually use 8 bit characters, so this is bad feature
	for me.  And I had interest with C interface facility and
	dynamic loading facility of Perl, so I thought it was a good
	chance for me to study them.  I made this module instead of
	fixing his module.

Prerequisites:
	You must have GNU Readline Library Version 2.1 or later.  See
	INSTALL for more detail.

How to build/install:
	See INSTALL.

Bugs:
	If you use Solaris 2.5 and dynamic loading, "make test" causes
	core dump.  The only fix I know now is to link this module
	statically.  See INSTALL for more details.

	The GNU Readline Library is very stable.  But this is my first
	XS programming, my first Perl module programming, and my first
	object oriented programming, and...  There must be many bugs
	in both programs and documents (especially in English
	grammar).  Comments and bug reports are very welcome.

Revision History:

1.00  1998-04-15
	- the 1st major release

	- ornaments feature is now on by default as recent
	  Term::ReadLine and Term::ReadLine::Perl

	- document fix
		remove description related to mymalloc

	- add ornaments-change function to t/readline.t which
	  demonstrates rl_message().

0.10  1998-03-31
	- new functions/variables
		ornaments support
		newTTY() (not tested)
		max_input_history
		read_history() (an aliase of read_history_range())
		unstifle_history()
		history_search_pos()
		history_list()
		history_tokenize() (Thank you, Tim Thomas)
		history_arg_extract()
		get_history_event()
	- new sample/test programs
		eg/fileman
		t/history.t
	- bug fix
		dynamic loading works on Solaris2.x (define xfree() locally)
		readline() calls add_history() only when MinLength > 0
		Feature `addhistory' is renamed to `addHistory' since
		Term/ReadLine.pm is fixed.
		add NULL check for all sv_setpv()
		remove arguments 'pos' from history_search()
	- misc
		change my E-mail address

0.09  Mon Aug 25 00:33:29 1997
	- add documentation about readline-2.1.tar.gz
	- add documentation about Solaris 2.5 with dynamic loading
	- bug fix
		fix for Digital Unix C compiler
	- add two sample programs
		eg/pftp		An ftp client with the GNU Readline support
		eg/ptksh+	Simple perl/Tk shell which demonstrates
				the callback functions

0.08  Sun Apr 13 23:24:52 1997

	- bug fix: AddHistory() accepts list again.
	- move perlsh into eg/.
	- add eg/ptksh+ which demonstrates the callback functions.
	  Thank you Achim.
	- add eg/pftp: an ftp client which has much the GNU Readline support.
	- Author's Email address is changed.
	- internal functions, fetch_var() and store_var(), are removed.

0.07  Wed Mar 19 02:26:06 1997

	- interface to internal function and variables are changed.
	  New interface is compatible with new Term::ReadLine.pm which
	  is distributed with Perl 5.003_92 and later.  But it is not
	  compatible with previous release.

		- add method interface to all internal function
		- add Attribs method to access internal variables
		- EXPORT_OK contains only some constant definitions

	- tkRunning support (new ReadLine.pm is required)
	- add document
	- bug fixes
		- XS bugs correspond to callback interface
		- fix _rl_store_function() and _rl_fetch_function()
		- fix prototype of append_history
		- use new _rl_store_rl_line_buffer() instead of
		  reallocate rl_line_buffer.
		- etc.
