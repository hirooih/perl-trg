Term::ReadLine::Gnu --- GNU Readline Library wrapper module

	Copyright (c) 1996 Hiroo Hayashi.  All rights reserved.

	This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
	modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.

Description:

	This is an implementation of the interface to the GNU Readline
	Library.  This module gives you input line editing facility,
	input history management ficility, word completion facility,
	etc.  It uses the real GNU Readline Library which is very
	strong and used by many people over the World, so it works
	just like using the GNU Readline Library :-)

	Ilya Zakharevich distributes his implementation, which bases
	on Jeffrey Friedl's readline.pl.  This works very good, and is
	easy to install.  But unfortunately this package is not 8 bit
	clean.  We Japanese usually use 8 bit characters, so this is
	bad feature for me.  Because I had interest with C interface
	facility and dynamic loading facility and it was a good chance
	for me to study them, I made this module instead of fixing his
	module.

Prerequisites:
	You must make GNU Readline Library.  See INSTALL.

How to build/install:
	See INSTALL.

Bugs:
	The GNU Readline Library is very stable.  But this is my first
	XS programming, my first module programming and, my first
	object oriented programming, ...  Yes, there must be many bugs
	in both programs and documents.  Comments and bug reports are
	very welcome.
