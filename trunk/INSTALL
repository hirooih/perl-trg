1. How to Install Term::ReadLine::Gnu

	You need the GNU Readline library installed.  Except this, you
	can install this module by the standard method, i.e.

		perl Makefile.PL; make install

1.1 Install GNU Readline library 2.1 or later and their header files.

	See the section `How to Install GNU Readline Library'.

1.2 Make and install

	% perl Makefile.PL [--prefix=...] [--includedir=...] [--libdir=...]
	% make
	% make test
	% make install

	If you have installed the GNU Readline Library
	(libreadline.{a,so} and readline/readline.h, etc.) on
	directories for which your perl is not configured to search
	(refer the value of ccflags and libpath in the output of `perl
	-V'), specify the paths as follows;

	% perl Makefile.PL --includedir=/mydir/include --libdir=/mydir/lib

	This example equivalent with the follows;

	% perl Makefile.PL --prefix=/mydir

	If you are not an administrator and cannot install Perl module
	in your system directory, try
		perldoc perlfaq8
	and see the section 'How do I keep my own module/library
	directory?'. (This section is for Perl 5.6 document.)

1.3 Trouble Shooting

	If you have any troubles during using this module, please let
	me (hiroo.hayashi@computer.org) know them by E-Mail.  It may
	help people who has same problem.  I'm sorry that I cannot
	watch all articles on comp.lang.perl.modules.

	When you report me your trouble, send me the result of `perl
	-V' and which compiler you use to compile the GNU Readline
	Library (libreadline.a).


2. How to Install GNU Readline Library

	Now this module supports only GNU Readline Library 2.1 and
	later. Executing `perl Makefile.PL` detects which version of
	the GNU Readline Library is already installed and warns you if
	you have the unsupported version.

	In the following example, the install prefix directory is
	`/usr/local/gnu'.
	
	You can specify any directory for the GNU Readline library and
	its header files, by editing `LIBS' and/or `INC' section in
	Makefile.PL.

2.1. Install

	readline-2.2.tar.gz has some bugs, so I strongly recommend you
	to use readline-2.2.1.tar.gz and/or later instead.

	1. get and extract readline-XX.tar.gz

	2. configure
		% ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/gnu
	3. make and install
		% make install

	If you have any reason in which use must use one of the follows;
		readline-2.1
		libreadline.a in bash-2.0.tar.gz
		Cygwin b20.1
	see INSTALL file which is included in Term-ReadLine-Gnu-1.11.

2.2 Shared Library

	If you want to build it as shared library, use readline-4.0
	(or later).  Type `make shared' instead of `make' to build
	shared library.

	You HAVE TO build the library as shared library on the
	following OSs;
		HPUX

	You DON'T HAVE TO and may build the library as shared library
	on the following OSs;
		GNU/Linux 2.x
		SunOS 4.x, 5.x
		AIX 4.1.x
		Cygwin 20.x

	# Please let me know on your experience on others OSs.

2.3 Multibyte Character (Japanese character) Handling

	Since the GNU Readline Library is 8 bit clean, I use Japanese
	characters without any patch.  But I have to hit Backspace key
	twice to erase a Japanese character.
	
	If you are using EUC Japanese charactor try to use
	Gnu/euc_jp.pm module.
